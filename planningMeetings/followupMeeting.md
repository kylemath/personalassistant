# Follow-up Meeting Notes

Date: March 19, 2024, 5:00 PM
Location: Virtual Meeting
Attendees:

- Prof. Rachel Sullivan (Lab Co-Director)
- Dr. Emily Thompson (HCI/UX Researcher)

## Discussion Summary

**Rachel**: Thank you for the comprehensive proposal, Emily. David and I are quite excited about the potential of the context bubbles concept. We'd like to discuss some refinements and suggestions we think could help strengthen the implementation.

**Emily**: Thank you for the feedback. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts about the UI complexity concerns you mentioned.

**Rachel**: Yes, that's one of our key points. While we love the concept, we're thinking about ways to introduce these features gradually to avoid overwhelming users. Could you share your thoughts on a potential phased approach?

**Emily**: Absolutely. We could start with basic relationship mapping - perhaps just showing connections between calendar events and related emails. Then gradually introduce file relationships, and finally add the predictive features. Would that align with what you're envisioning?

**Rachel**: Exactly. We're also thinking about progressive disclosure in the UI itself. Maybe starting with a simple "related items" panel that users can expand to see more complex relationships?

**Emily**: That makes a lot of sense. We could use a hierarchy:

1. Level 1: Direct relationships (email â†’ calendar event)
2. Level 2: Derived relationships (suggested files for meetings)
3. Level 3: Predictive features (future context prediction)

**Rachel**: Perfect. David also raised some technical considerations about performance. Have you thought about caching strategies for frequently accessed contexts?

**Emily**: We've discussed it briefly. Marcus suggested pre-computing common relationships during off-peak hours. We could also cache the most frequently accessed contexts for each user. Would you like us to develop a more detailed caching strategy?

**Rachel**: Yes, that would be helpful. We're also thinking about privacy considerations. Users should have clear control over what relationships are automatically inferred.

**Emily**: We could add privacy settings at different levels:

1. Data type level (e.g., enable/disable email analysis)
2. Relationship level (e.g., manual approval for new relationship types)
3. Context level (e.g., private contexts that aren't automatically shared)

**Rachel**: Excellent thinking. Now, regarding resources - we're prepared to allocate additional GPU capacity for the NLP processing and set up the graph database infrastructure. What would be your team's most immediate needs?

**Emily**: Initially, we'd need:

1. Development environment for prototyping
2. User testing facilities for early feedback
3. Access to sample datasets for relationship inference testing

**Rachel**: We can arrange that. We'd also like to set up regular progress reviews. How does bi-weekly sound, with more frequent check-ins during critical phases?

**Emily**: That would work well. It would give us enough time to make meaningful progress between reviews while keeping the feedback loop tight.

## Action Items

**Emily**:

1. Draft detailed phased implementation plan
2. Design progressive disclosure UI mockups
3. Develop privacy control specifications
4. Create sample dataset requirements

**Rachel**:

1. Arrange development environment setup
2. Schedule bi-weekly progress reviews
3. Coordinate with David on technical resource allocation
4. Share UX guidelines document

## Next Steps

1. Team to submit revised implementation plan by end of week
2. Initial development environment setup next week
3. First progress review scheduled for two weeks from today
4. Begin user testing protocol development

## Key Takeaways

1. **Implementation Approach**

   - Phased rollout of features
   - Progressive disclosure in UI
   - Strong focus on user privacy controls

2. **Technical Considerations**

   - Implement caching strategy
   - Regular performance optimization
   - Privacy-first architecture

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Development environment priority
   - User testing facilities
   - Regular progress reviews

## Closing Notes

Both parties agree on the refined approach with its emphasis on gradual feature introduction and user-centric design. The project will proceed with the discussed modifications and regular check-ins to ensure alignment with goals.

Meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM
