# MVP Production Plan

## Initial Planning Meeting

**Maria**: Let's break down our MVP into manageable chunks and decide on the order of implementation. What are your thoughts?

**David**: From a frontend perspective, I suggest this order:

1. Basic layout structure (grid for dashboard/chat)
2. Individual widget components (empty shells)
3. Chat integration (since it's mostly working)
4. Dashboard widgets with static data
5. Redux integration
6. Real data integration

**Chen**: I'd approach it differently:

1. Set up Redux store first
2. WebSocket connection
3. Basic data flow
4. Then UI components
   This way we ensure data patterns are solid before building UI.

**Maria**: Both approaches have merit. Let's discuss testing strategy first. How should we validate each step?

**David**: For UI components:

- Jest unit tests for logic
- React Testing Library for components
- Storybook for visual testing
- Manual testing for interactions

**Chen**: For data flow:

- Unit tests for Redux reducers
- Integration tests for WebSocket
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Mock API responses initially

**Maria**: Let's define our testing checkpoints. What must be tested before moving to the next step?

**Maria**: Let's map out our critical testing checkpoints. What are our "must pass" criteria?

**Chen**: For data flow, I propose these checkpoints:

1. Redux Store Setup:

   ```typescript
   // Must successfully:
   - Initialize store with default state
   - Handle basic actions
   - Connect to React components
   - Maintain type safety
   ```

2. WebSocket Integration:
   ```typescript
   // Verify:
   - Connection establishment
   - Message handling
   - Reconnection logic
   - Error handling
   ```

**David**: For UI, critical checkpoints are:

1. Layout Structure:

   ```typescript
   // Verify:
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Widget containers sized correctly
   - Chat panel integration
   - Mobile breakpoints
   ```

2. Component Integration:
   ```typescript
   // Each widget must:
   - Render with mock data
   - Handle loading states
   - Show error states
   - Update with new data
   ```

**Maria**: What about dependencies between components? How do we handle the integration points?

**Chen**: Key integration points are:

1. WebSocket → Redux:

   ```typescript
   interface WebSocketMessage {
     type: 'calendar' | 'email' | 'todo';
     action: 'update' | 'create' | 'delete';
     payload: any;
   }

   // Must handle:
   - Message validation
   - State updates
   - Error recovery
   ```

2. Redux → Components:
   ```typescript
   // Verify:
   - Selector performance
   - Update batching
   - State synchronization
   ```

**David**: For the UI flow:

1. User Interactions:

   ```typescript
   // Test scenarios:
   - Widget refresh
   - Command input
   - Error recovery
   - Loading states
   ```

2. Component Communication:
   ```typescript
   // Verify:
   - Event bubbling
   - Prop updates
   - State consistency
   ```

**Maria**: Let's define our MVP milestones. What's the minimum for each release?

**Chen**: I suggest three MVP stages:

1. Alpha (Internal):

   - Basic Redux store
   - Mock data flow
   - Simple UI shells

2. Beta (Team Testing):

   - Real data integration
   - Basic error handling
   - Core features working

3. Release Candidate:
   - Full WebSocket support
   - Polished UI
   - Performance optimized

**David**: For UI milestones:

1. Alpha:

   ```typescript
   // Components needed:
   -DashboardLayout - BasicWidget - SimpleChatWindow;
   ```

2. Beta:

   ```typescript
   // Added features:
   - Widget interactions
   - Real-time updates
   - Error states
   ```

3. RC:
   ```typescript
   // Polish:
   - Loading animations
   - Transitions
   - Mobile support
   ```

**Maria**: After considering both approaches, here's my decision:

## Final Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

1. Day 1-2: Basic Setup
   - Create React App with TypeScript
   - Redux Toolkit setup
   - Basic layout structure
2. Day 3-4: Core Components

   - Dashboard grid
   - Widget shells
   - Chat panel integration

3. Day 5: Initial Testing
   - Unit tests
   - Layout verification
   - Integration tests

### Phase 2: Data Integration (Week 2)

1. Day 1-2: Redux Implementation

   - Store structure
   - Action creators
   - Reducers

2. Day 3-4: API Integration

   - WebSocket setup
   - Data fetching
   - Error handling

3. Day 5: Testing & Fixes
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Bug fixes

### Phase 3: Feature Completion (Week 3)

1. Day 1-2: Widget Implementation

   - Calendar widget
   - Email widget
   - Todo widget

2. Day 3-4: Chat Integration

   - Command handling
   - Real-time updates
   - Error states

3. Day 5: Final Testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - UX testing

### Testing Strategy

1. Every Component:

   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Visual verification

2. Every Feature:

   - Functionality testing
   - Error handling
   - Performance benchmarks

3. Daily Requirements:
   - All tests passing
   - No TypeScript errors
   - No console errors

### Success Criteria

1. MVP Features:

   - Dashboard displays correctly
   - Widgets show real data
   - Chat functions properly
   - Basic commands work

2. Performance:

   - Initial load < 2s
   - Updates < 100ms
   - No visible lag

3. Quality:
   - 90% test coverage
   - Zero critical bugs
   - Type-safe codebase

**Maria**: This plan balances both frontend and backend needs while maintaining quality. Thoughts?

**David**: Agreed. The progressive enhancement approach makes sense.

**Chen**: The testing requirements are solid. I'm comfortable with this plan.

**Maria**: Then let's begin with Phase 1. David, you start on the layout structure. Chen, begin Redux setup. I'll coordinate and review PRs.

Would you like to proceed with Phase 1 implementation?
